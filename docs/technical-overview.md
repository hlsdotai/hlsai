# Technical Overview

HLS.ai introduces a patent-pending approach to video streaming that enhances
traditional HLS/DASH workflows.

## Key Features
- **Adaptive Segmentation**: Efficiently balances segment size and latency.
- **Optimized Buffering**: Player maintains smoother playback under poor
  network conditions.
- **Reduced Overhead**: Lower bandwidth consumption compared to HLS/DASH.

## Differentiation
- Unlike HLS, segments are optimized dynamically.
- Unlike DASH, no complex manifest switching overhead is required.
- Compared to RTMP, latency is significantly lower while remaining HTTP-based.

## Patent Pending
This technology is the subject of a pending patent application.  
Commercial use requires a license â€” see [Commercial License](./commercial-license.md).
